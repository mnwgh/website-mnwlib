# Welcome to the (code for the) library!

This is the GitHub repo for my HTML, CSS and Javascript personal project. I created a website for digitizing my personal library and to learn about web development. In my career, I do back-end development for operating systems, so, creating this website was something totally different than my day to day job. Front-end development is a lot of fun! I was always so excited to work on this website and couldn't wait until I could start another project. Since this was my first big web development project, there are probably a lot of things that could be better. I plan to use this website to further my education of web development so I can create other websites with cool features! I already have a few website ideas lined up. I am very excited to go on this journey, thanks for following along!
