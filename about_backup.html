            <h3>My name is Maleah Necole Willis, aka MNW, and this is my personal library!</h3>
            <p>I started mnwlib.com as a way to digitize my library and learn about web development. 
              That's right, I coded this website myself!</p>
            <p>If you didn't already guess, I am a software developer. For my career, I work on operating systems which means 
              I have some back-end developer experience.</p>
            <p>Creating this website has helped me develop some front-end skills and it has been a blast!</p>

            <h3>I'm on a journey to own every book I've ever read!</h3>
            <p>My goal of owning every book I ever read started when I found out thrift stores sell books. 
              Most of my thrift store trips start in the book section and I often find myself buying several books. 
              It started with me buying books I had read in my childhood and now I just fully use thrift stores as used book stores!</p>
            <p>My library is quite special to me because it shows years and years of my love of reading. 
              Growing up, I always had lots of books but never anywhere to really store them. In college, 
              I was given my first bookshelf, a hand-me down from my aunt. That one bookshelf has grown into this!</p>

            <h3>A little more about me...</h3>
            <p>I have loved to read my entire life! Trips to the library were my favorite summer activity. Books as a gift was the most exciting thing! 
              I still own every book I've been gifted!</p>
            <p>Besides reading and collecting books, I also love to play video games. I am a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/mnwtv_" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;" target="_blank">hobbyist Twitch streamer</a> who loves to play 
              The Sims, Stardew Valley, Poptropica and other cozy games.</p>
            <p>Although web development has been super fun, I would love to use my computer programming skills to make my own video games. 
              I have developed a few games with my friends, check those out <a href="https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-build-v2" style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
            <p>One day I hope to create another website that hosts all the games I make so stay tuned for that!</p>

            <h3>Thank you so much for following along!</h3>
            <p>This will most likely be an ongoing project for me as I plan to buy more books and will need to add them to the catalogue. So please join me on this journey of web development and owning every book I have ever read!</p>
            <p>I implore you to <a href="/index.html#suggest" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;" target="_blank">suggest me your favorite book</a>, especially if you don't see it in my collection! I can't wait to see what books you all love to read!</p>
